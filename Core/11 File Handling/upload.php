<?php
// A PHP script can be used with a HTML form to allow users to upload files to the server. Initially files are uploaded into a temporary directory and then relocated to a target destination by a PHP script.

// Information in the phpinfo.php page describes the temporary directory that is used for file uploads as upload_tmp_dir and the maximum permitted size of files that can be uploaded is stated as upload_max_filesize. These parameters are set into PHP configuration file php.ini

// The process of uploading a file follows these steps âˆ’

// The user opens the page containing a HTML form featuring a text files, a browse button and a submit button.

// The user clicks the browse button and selects a file to upload from the local PC.

// The full path to the selected file appears in the text filed then the user clicks the submit button.

// The selected file is sent to the temporary directory on the server.

// The PHP script that was specified as the form handler in the form's action attribute checks that the file has arrived and then copies the file into an intended directory.

// The PHP script confirms the success to the user.
