<!-- PHP What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.We can imagine our universe made of different objects like sun, earth, moon etc. 
Similarly we can imagine our car made of different objects like wheel, steering, gear etc. 
The Four major principles of OOP are;


Encapsulation: 
Encapsulation Restrict Data Directly Access and Manage Complexity Using Access Modifiers;

Inheritance – Extend Other Class and Create Relation Between Other Classes. And Get Other Class Properties and Methods;

Polymorphism – this is concerned with having a single form but many different implementation ways. The main purpose of polymorphism is;
Simplify maintaining applications and making them more extendable

Abstraction – this is concerned with having a single form but many different implementation ways. The main purpose of polymorphism is;
Simplify maintaining applications and making them more extendable
